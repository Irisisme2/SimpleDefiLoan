# Simple DeFi Loan Platform

## Introduction
The **Simple DeFi Loan Platform** is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to revolutionize the way loans are handled within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Built on the Rootstock (RSK) network, this platform leverages the security of Bitcoin while utilizing Solidity-based smart contracts to manage loan agreements. This project aims to provide a seamless, transparent, and secure method for users to request and offer loans using rBTC (Rootstock Bitcoin).

## Problem Statement
Traditional loan systems are often bogged down by lengthy approval processes, high fees, and a lack of transparency. Decentralized finance (DeFi) has the potential to address these issues, but many existing solutions are built on networks that do not offer the robust security of Bitcoin. The Simple DeFi Loan Platform seeks to bridge this gap by bringing DeFi functionality to the Bitcoin network via Rootstock, enabling users to benefit from both the security of Bitcoin and the flexibility of smart contracts.

## Project Goals
1. **Facilitate Easy Loan Requests and Offers**: Provide a user-friendly interface for borrowers to request loans and for lenders to offer loans.
2. **Ensure Transparency and Security**: Use smart contracts to manage loan agreements, ensuring that all terms are transparent and immutable.
3. **Leverage Bitcoin's Security**: Build on the Rootstock network to ensure that all transactions benefit from Bitcoin's robust security features.

## Key Features
1. **üìã Loan Request Form**: Borrowers can easily fill out a form specifying the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment period.
2. **üìú Loan Offers Listing**: Lenders can browse a list of loan requests and choose to fund those that meet their criteria.
3. **üìä Loan Management Dashboard**: Both borrowers and lenders have access to a dashboard where they can view active loans, repayment schedules, and transaction history.
4. **üîê Smart Contract Integration**: The platform interacts with Rootstock smart contracts to handle the creation and repayment of loans, ensuring that all processes are automated and secure.

## Technical Implementation
The project is built using React.js for the front-end, with Chakra UI for the user interface components, ensuring a modern and responsive design. The back-end is integrated with the Rootstock network, leveraging its EVM compatibility to deploy and interact with Solidity-based smart contracts.

## Deliverables
1. **Deployed Smart Contract**: A smart contract deployed on the Rootstock testnet to manage loan agreements.
2. **Successful On-Chain Transactions**: At least two successful on-chain transactions demonstrating loan creation and repayment.
3. **GitHub Repository**: A public repository containing the project's source code and a descriptive README file.
4. **Pitch Video**: A video pitch explaining the project's concept, features, and demonstrating its functionality.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-defi-loan-platform.git
    cd simple-defi-loan-platform
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

4. **Deploy the smart contract**:
    Follow the instructions in the `smart-contracts` folder to deploy the smart contract to the Rootstock testnet.

## Usage
1. **Request a Loan**: Navigate to the loan request form and fill out the necessary details.
2. **View Loan Offers**: Browse the list of loan requests and choose one to fund.
3. **Manage Loans**: Use the dashboard to track active loans, view repayment schedules, and monitor transaction history.

## Future Enhancements
Post-hackathon, the project can be expanded to include additional features such as:
- Enhanced loan analytics and reporting tools.
- Support for multi-collateral loans.
- Integration with other DeFi protocols and services on Rootstock.
- Improved security features and audits.
